## üî• Blazing Tools
PacketBlaze equips you with cutting-edge tools to supercharge your network analysis:

- **[Interactive Packet Analyzer](scripts/interactive_analyzer.py)**: A Python script to explore PCAPs effortlessly. List HTTP requests, count ICMP packets, or dive into protocols with a few clicks. Try it:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/interactive_analyzer.py
  ```
- **Prebuilt Display Filters**: Hit the ground running with filters like `http`, `icmp`, `tcp.port == 80`, or `dns`. Challenges embed these filters to highlight key packets instantly, saving you time.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate actionable insights with Wireshark‚Äôs `Statistics` (e.g., protocol hierarchy, packet lengths) or our script‚Äôs custom outputs (e.g., protocol counts). Share your findings to earn badges!
- **Future Enhancements**: Stay tuned for AI-driven filter suggestions, visual packet dashboards, and automated report generators (Q4 2025‚Äì2026).

These tools streamline complex tasks, making PacketBlaze perfect for beginners, educators, and seasoned analysts.
